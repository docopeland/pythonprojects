# Hangman
The game in side of the python file is just like the hangman game you played growing up, except no drawing of a hanged person (cause seriously?)
You have to try guess the word (any word from the words_alpha.txt file that has less than 6 letters). 
You can only make 6 incorrect guesses before you lose.
